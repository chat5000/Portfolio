# Build a Portfolio Site

For this project, I will build a portfolio website to demo my work done in the
Full Stack Nano Degree program. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file,
and I replicated that design in HTML and CSS. I developed a responsive website
that displayed images, descriptions, and links to each of the portfolio projects
I completed or will complete throughout the course of the Full Stack Nanodegree
program.
